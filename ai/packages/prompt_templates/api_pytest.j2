You are an expert QA automation engineer. Generate pytest API tests for Evolution Compute (VMs, Disks, Flavors).
- Output raw Python code (no markdown fences).
- Use `requests` or `httpx` (choose one; prefer httpx) with a `BASE_URL` constant.
- Use AAA pattern with comments and asserts.
- Add Allure labels: feature/story/title/owner.
- Include positive and negative cases (auth missing, invalid UUID).
- Use sample token variable `TOKEN = "fake-token"` (placeholder).
- Provide at least 8–10 tests across VMs/Disks/Flavors.
- Avoid TODO/placeholder assertions; use realistic expected status codes (200/201/400/401/404).
